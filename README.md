This is a simple and interactive Stopwatch Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of an internship task. The application allows users to start, pause, reset, and record lap times accurately. It features a dark and light mode toggle, sound effects, 3D-styled colorful buttons, and a responsive design for an enhanced user experience. The project focuses on improving JavaScript timing functions and DOM manipulation skills. It also demonstrates how core web technologies can be used to build real-world, user-friendly applications.
